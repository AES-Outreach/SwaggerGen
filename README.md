# SwaggerGen
The goal of this project is create a set of tools that will automagically create a set of documentation for APIs. Documentation has a tendency to get stale quite quickly because developers want to work on solving problems, not writing about them. We want to offer a solution to ourselves and others as web developers to auto-generate the documentation based on a minimalist set of annotations that are to be integrated seamlessly in the developer workflow using the following technologies:

* Swagger
* Maven
* Java annotations
* JSON schemas
